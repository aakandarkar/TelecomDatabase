# Telecom Database Management System

Project Abstract: 
A Telecommunications company with diverse set of telecommunication products and services wants to leverage its customer data, for gaining actionable insights to boost its sales and try and create a monopoly in the industry using targeted marketing and on the fly services. The firm provides services such as internet services (wireline & wireless), Cable TV, telephone & mobile services, Voice over IP and over the top (OTT) video streaming services similar to video on demand.

Currently, majority of the billing & customer related data is handled physically, and the firm is planning on going digital on all its data sources. This transition will not only bring all data sources together but will also make data available on the go. This project will additionally help in creating better actionable marketing insights due to all forms of data integrated at one place, which will be used by leadership teams for running marketing campaigns.

For instance, data collected while creating a new account for a customer will include customer location data in form of address, this geographic and demographic data will be further used to understand which population and what areas are already exposed to what products, which will be used to market the products accordingly where required. A geographic area where majority of the population is above 50 years of age might not go for OTT video streaming services but might use Cable TV or telephone services. On the contrary, areas near an educational university will have students in huge numbers where the OTT services and VOIP services might become popular as some international students might want to make international calls where VOIP will come into picture.
